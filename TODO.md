# Two Stars Game - Simple MVP Implementation

## Step 1: Add Basic Game Status âœ…

  - [x] Add visual feedback for invalid moves (simple red border)

## Step 4: Add Board Selection & Reset âœ…

**Goal**: Let players choose boards and restart games

- [x] Create additional board objects:

  - [x] "New Game" button to restart current board
  - [x] When board is selected, reset game state and load new board
  - [x] Show current board name/number in the UI

## That's It! ðŸŽ‰

This creates a **complete, playable game** with:

- âœ… Core puzzle mechanics (already working)
- âœ… Win detection and feedback
- âœ… Game reset functionality
- âœ… Invalid move prevention
- âœ… Basic visual polish

## Future Additions (Post-MVP)

Only add these **after** the MVP is complete and tested:

- [ ] Timer/scoring
- [ ] Undo functionality
- [ ] Statistics tracking
- [ ] Mobile optimization
- [ ] Accessibility features

## MVP Guidelines

- **No timers** - Just focus on puzzle completion
- **No complex state management** - Use existing React state
- **No modals** - Simple inline messages
- **No routing** - Single page application
- **No persistence** - Game resets on page reload
- **No animations** - Basic CSS transitions only

## Implementation Philosophy

- Start with the simplest solution that works
- Add complexity only when the simple version is proven to work
- Each step should result in a fully functional game
- Don't build features you're not sure you need
